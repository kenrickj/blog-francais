This site is currently under construction and is as much a programming exercise as it is a foreign language practice tool.  I used jekyll to build the framework
of this site in order to better utilize the efficiencies of Github for version
control and updating the site daily.  I have drawn much inspiration from many
other sites' layouts, designs and javascript/jQuery plugins and code snippets.  In
every case I have opted to rewrite the markup, design, or script code after learning
the code's design and syntax.

My intent for the content of this site is to publish a blog daily in French in order to improve my French proficiency. I intend to periodically post my blog entries on [Lang-8](http://lang-8.com/) for correction by native speakers and adjusting my blog entries to reflect the corrections.
