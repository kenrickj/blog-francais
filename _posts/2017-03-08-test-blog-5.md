This is a test blog to *determine*[^1] how best to provide definitions for new words on the French Blog.  This particular test is for the footnote method.  Basically, I will write the *words*[^2] in italics that I will provide a footnote for and reference *below*[^3].


[^1]: definition of "determine".
[^2]: definition of "words".
[^3]: definition of "below".
