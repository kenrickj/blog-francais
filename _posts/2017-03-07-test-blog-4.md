This is a test blog to determine how best to provide definitions for new words on the French Blog.  This particular test is for the term definition method.  Basically, I will write the *words* in italics that I will define below then I will provide a list of *terms* and definitions below the main *text* and give it a class of *vocabulary*.  

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div class="vocab">
words
:definition of "words"

terms
:definition of "terms"

text
:definition of "text"

vocabulary
:definition of "vocabulary"
</div>
